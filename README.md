Pixie Quest 2, The Pixie Queen's Challenge


This is a game I'm writing to teach my daughter how to do arithmetic. It features the protagonist, who has to defeat the ignoramuses through the power of maths. Each correct answer to a arithmetic problem brings some enlightenment to the ignoramuses and once all their ignorance is drained, they run off to tell their friends. 

Essentially, it's a remake of the cheesy side scrolling platformer my father wrote for me when I was a kid, thanks dad. thad.
